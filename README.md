# ai_algo

These are classical **artificial intelligence (AI)** problems often used to teach or demonstrate concepts in **state-space search**, **problem-solving**, and **heuristic methods** in AI. Letâ€™s go through each of them:

---

### **1. E8_Puzzle Problem**
- **Description**: The **8-puzzle** (or sliding puzzle) consists of a 3x3 grid with tiles numbered 1 to 8, and one empty space. The goal is to rearrange the tiles to reach a specific configuration (goal state) by sliding tiles into the empty space.
- **Key Concepts**: 
  - **State Space**: All possible configurations of the grid.
  - **Initial State**: The starting arrangement of the tiles.
  - **Goal State**: A pre-defined arrangement (e.g., tiles in numerical order with the empty space in the last position).
  - **Actions**: Moving tiles up, down, left, or right.
  - **Search Algorithms**: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), A* (with heuristics like Manhattan Distance or Misplaced Tiles).

### **2. WOLF_GOAT Problem**
- **Description**: This is a river-crossing puzzle. A man needs to transport a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage across a river using a boat. The boat can carry only one item at a time, and the following rules apply:
  - The wolf cannot be left alone with the goat (the wolf will eat the goat).
  - The goat cannot be left alone with the cabbage (the goat will eat the cabbage).
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **State Space**: All possible combinations of items on each side of the river.
  - **Actions**: Moving the man and one item across the river.
  - **Constraints**: Valid configurations must adhere to the rules.
  - **Search Algorithm**: BFS or DFS is commonly used to explore valid sequences of actions.

### **3. Cannibal Missionary Problem**
- **Description**: Similar to the Wolf-Goat problem, but with the following twist:
  - Three missionaries and three cannibals need to cross a river using a boat.
  - The boat can carry at most two people at a time.
  - At no point can the number of cannibals exceed the number of missionaries on either side of the river (or the cannibals will eat the missionaries).
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **State Representation**: The number of missionaries and cannibals on each side of the river.
  - **Actions**: Moving one or two individuals in the boat.
  - **Constraints**: Ensure valid configurations.
  - **Solution Techniques**: State-space search with path pruning to eliminate invalid states.

### **4. Monkey_Banana Problem**
- **Description**: A monkey wants to grab a banana hanging from the ceiling. The room contains a box the monkey can use to reach the banana. The problem involves a sequence of actions:
  - The monkey must move to the box.
  - Push the box under the banana.
  - Climb the box to reach the banana.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **State Representation**: Position of the monkey, box, and banana.
  - **Actions**: Moving, pushing the box, climbing, grabbing.
  - **Goal State**: Monkey has the banana.
  - **Techniques**: Often modeled using STRIPS (a planning system) or state-space search.

### **5. Water_Jug Problem**
- **Description**: Given two jugs of different capacities, the goal is to measure out an exact amount of water using the jugs. For example:
  - You have a 3-liter jug and a 5-liter jug, and you need exactly 4 liters.
  - You can fill, empty, or pour water from one jug into another.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **State Representation**: Amount of water in each jug.
  - **Actions**: Fill a jug, empty a jug, pour water from one jug into another.
  - **Constraints**: Capacity limits of the jugs.
  - **Search Algorithm**: BFS or DFS can find a valid sequence of actions.

### **Applications in AI**
These problems are used to teach:
- **State Representation**: Modeling problems in terms of states and actions.
- **Search Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, Uniform Cost Search, A*.
- **Constraints**: Handling problem-specific constraints effectively.
- **Heuristics**: Designing and using heuristics to optimize search processes.
